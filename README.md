# What is Reanimal?

[Reanimal](https://www.reanimal.pro/) is an indie narrative survival game set in a decaying biotech world — a place where science has crossed ethical boundaries, and humanity’s remnants struggle to reclaim control.  
It’s a story-driven experience that fuses psychological horror, simulation, and emotional decision-making into one haunting journey.

## 🧬 Story and Setting

You play as a test subject who awakens inside an abandoned bio-engineering facility. The world outside has collapsed after a failed experiment aimed at merging animal DNA with human physiology — an attempt to cure disease that instead created something far worse.  
As you escape the lab, you begin to piece together who you are, what went wrong, and why the facility’s AI still recognizes you as “Property 019.”

Every corridor hides a fragment of truth — diaries, recordings, mutated plants that remember voices. Your survival is not only physical but psychological: **how far are you willing to go to stay human?**

## ⚙️ Gameplay Features

- **Survival Management:**  
  Manage your hunger, sanity, and infection levels. Each decision — to rest, to inject a serum, or to scavenge — affects your transformation rate.

- **Branching Choices:**  
  Your dialogue and actions permanently change story outcomes. Save a creature, or harvest it for organs. No decision is purely moral — every act has biological consequences.

- **DNA System:**  
  Collect genetic samples and fuse traits to gain abilities — night vision, regeneration, or heightened instincts — but lose parts of your humanity in the process.

- **Multiple Endings:**  
  Over **10+ narrative outcomes**, from redemption to total assimilation. Replayability is core to the Reanimal experience.

- **Dynamic World State:**  
  The world remembers your choices. Abandoned areas evolve, creatures migrate, and new dialogue options appear as your infection spreads.

## 🎨 Art & Atmosphere

Reanimal uses pixel art inspired by classic PlayStation aesthetics, combining soft lighting and glitch-inspired distortion to evoke a feeling of uneasy nostalgia.  
Sound design blends organic and mechanical textures — heartbeats echo through vents, whispers overlap with ventilation noise, creating a claustrophobic, living environment.

Every sound, texture, and line of dialogue is crafted to immerse players in an environment that feels **alive but wrong.**

## 🧠 Inspirations

Reanimal draws inspiration from psychological horror masterpieces like *SOMA*, *Pathologic*, and *The Last of Us*, while integrating decision systems closer to *This War of Mine* and *Papers, Please*.  
Its focus is not just survival, but **moral introspection** — exploring how trauma, empathy, and mutation coexist in a collapsing world.

## 🧩 Development & Vision

The project began as a solo developer experiment — a mix of narrative writing, procedural world-building, and emotional AI simulation. Over time, it evolved into a fully realized indie title built with **Godot** and **custom narrative scripting tools**.

> “Reanimal isn’t about defeating monsters — it’s about understanding what makes something human.”

The development philosophy behind Reanimal is minimalist yet emotional: tell deep stories with limited assets, and let player imagination fill the gaps.
